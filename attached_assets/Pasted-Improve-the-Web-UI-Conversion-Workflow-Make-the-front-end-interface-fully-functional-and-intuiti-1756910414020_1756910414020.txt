Improve the Web UI & Conversion Workflow – Make the front-end interface fully functional and intuitive, aligned with the above backend changes:
	•	Hook up settings to functionality: When a user selects options or presets, ensure the app uses them in the conversion request. For example, if they choose a preset that implies preserving colors or a certain detail level, set the traceEngine appropriately before sending the /api/convert request. Similarly, the “Preserve Original Colors” toggle should not just freeze the preview but actually influence the conversion mode (perhaps by switching to traceEngine: 'imagetracer' under the hood).
	•	Real-time preview updates: The code already supports re-converting on setting changes (with debouncing) – verify this works after enabling color mode. Changing sliders (detail, smoothing, etc.) or toggles should update the SVG preview with minimal delay. This helps users fine-tune the vectorization (much like vectorizer.ai’s interactive adjustments).
	•	User feedback and errors: Make sure the UI displays helpful messages for errors (e.g. unsupported format, too large file – the backend sends specific errors). The conversionStatus state is used for messages like “Applying new settings…” or errors; ensure these are shown at the right times and reset appropriately.
	•	Download and copy functionality: The download button and “copy to clipboard” for SVG should be tested with the new changes. For instance, if multi-color SVGs are larger, ensure the copy still works. Also, when a user downloads, name the file appropriately (perhaps preserve the original name with .svg).
	•	Polish the UX: Consider adding a side-by-side or overlay comparison of original vs SVG (the code mentions a split view). Even if not critical, this can be a selling point. Ensure the layout (upload area, settings, preview) is responsive and clear. Small touches like showing a loading animation during conversion (the code has LoadingAnimation component) improve the experience.
	•	Outcome: The web app front-end should seamlessly support the new features, giving users a smooth experience to upload an image, configure settings, preview the vectorized result, and download the SVG. All controls should function as expected, making the tool feel “fully functional” and professional.
