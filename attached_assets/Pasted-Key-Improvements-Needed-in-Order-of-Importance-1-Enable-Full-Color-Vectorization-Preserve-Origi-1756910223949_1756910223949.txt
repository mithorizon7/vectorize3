Key Improvements Needed (in Order of Importance)
	1.	Enable Full-Color Vectorization (Preserve Original Colors) – The top priority is to allow the output SVG to retain the input image’s original colors instead of defaulting to black silhouettes. Currently, the conversion uses Potrace (monochrome) by default and explicitly sets all SVG paths to black ￼. To fix this:
	•	Integrate the existing color tracing workflow (using the ImageTracer library) for multi-color images ￼. For example, switch the default tracing engine to “auto” (or allow a user choice) so that colorful images get processed with ImageTracer (full-color) instead of Potrace ￼. This will preserve original hues in the vector output.
	•	Ensure the “Preserve Original Colors” option in the UI triggers the above behavior. Right now, the UI has a toggle for this feature ￼, but the backend must actually perform a color trace when it’s enabled (rather than simply skipping recoloring of an already black SVG). In practice, this means if the user wants original colors, use the full-color tracing pipeline (and do not replace path fills with black in post-processing).
	•	Fine-tune color tracing parameters (number of colors, color quantization/dithering, etc.) for quality. The code already allows specifying numberOfColors, preserveColors, etc. Make sure these settings produce a high-quality SVG that balances detail and file size. For example, for photographs you might use a higher color count, whereas simple graphics can use fewer colors for a cleaner result.
	•	Outcome: The service should output SVGs in full color for color images (just like vectorizer.ai does), making vectorized images closely resemble the original bitmap’s colors.
	2.	Support All Major Image Formats as Input – The service should accept and correctly handle common image file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, SVG) ￼. Right now, the upload backend allows these formats but does not convert them before tracing. To ensure compatibility and prevent errors:
	•	Implement image decoding/conversion: Use an image processing library (e.g. Sharp, already imported) to convert any uploaded image into a consistent format (such as a PNG bitmap in memory) before feeding it to the tracer. Currently the code writes the raw uploaded file buffer directly to a .png temp file ￼, which can misinterpret formats (e.g. writing a JPEG buffer with a .png extension). Instead, detect the format and convert the image bytes properly (e.g. if a JPEG is uploaded, decode it and pass the pixel data or convert to PNG for Potrace).
	•	Preserve transparency and color profiles: During conversion, make sure to keep alpha channels (for transparency) and color info. This ties into preserving backgrounds (next point) and color accuracy.
	•	Validate and test each format: Ensure JPEG/PNG work (these are most common). Also test with a GIF or WebP – the system should handle them or at least give a clear error if unsupported. Since the code already filters allowed types and limits file size (5MB) ￼, the developer should focus on proper decoding so that all allowed types actually get traced.
	•	Outcome: The user can upload any major image type and the service will reliably vectorize it. No color loss or errors due to format issues should occur.
	3.	Ensure Transparent Background in SVG Output – The exported SVGs should have no opaque background by default, so they can be overlaid on any background. In other words, areas that were transparent (or background-colored) in the original image should remain transparent in the SVG. To achieve this:
	•	Default to transparency: Remove any background rectangle or fill in the generated SVG. The backend has a utility to strip out a background <rect> for transparency ￼ – use this so that by default the SVG’s background is set to none (transparent). For example, if the tracing library adds a white background shape, post-process it out.
	•	If the original image has no transparency (e.g. a JPEG with a solid white background), consider offering an option to drop the background color during tracing (for instance, many vectorizers let you treat a white background as transparent). While this could be a later enhancement, at minimum ensure that if the user manually removes the background (or uploads a PNG with transparency), the vector output honors that.
	•	Confirm that when saving images (especially with Sharp or other library) you don’t inadvertently add a background. Potrace uses a background: '#fff' setting for thresholding, but that shouldn’t appear as an object in the SVG – make sure it doesn’t. And for ImageTracer, check if it outputs a background; if so, remove it by default.
	•	Outcome: All SVG exports will have a transparent canvas (unless a user intentionally adds a background). This meets the requirement of “definitely exporting with transparent backgrounds,” giving clean SVGs that only contain the vector shapes.
